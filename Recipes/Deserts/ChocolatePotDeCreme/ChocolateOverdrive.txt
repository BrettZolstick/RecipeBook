# Cookware

	1 medium saucepan
	2 medium mixing bowls
	1 fine strainer
	1 spatula
	1 ladel 
	1 Whisk
	4 ~6oz ramekins
	1 deep baking dish





# Instructions

	1. Prep
	
		1. Preheat the oven to 300F.
		2. Have all ingredients ready.

	2. Prepare the cream

		1. Set a medium saucepan on medium heat
		2. Add 2.5 cups of heavy whipping cream
		3. Add 150 grams of dark chocolate (60%-70%)
		4. Add 1 tsp of vanilla extract
		5. Add a pinch of salt
		6. Stir periodically until chocolate is completely melted


	3. Prepare the egg mix

		1. Set out a medium mixing bowl
		2. Add 8 egg yolks (yolks only)
		3. Add 40 grams of cocoa powder
		4. Add 2/3 cup of sugar
		5. Add Orange Zest (Optional)
		6. Whisk until it reaches a paste-like consistancy

		
	4. Combining the cream and egg mix (Tempering the egg)

		1. Gradually add the warm chocolate cream mixture to the egg mixture.

			- Doing this too quickly can result in the eggs curdling, go slowly to temper the eggs.
			- Avoid using a whisk or introducing air bubbles (for texture).

		2. Add 1 tbsp of Grand Mariner or other Orange Liquer (Optional)
		3. Taste and add additional cocoa or sugar if needed 
		3. Strain with a fine seive into a separate mixing bowl or pouring container		
		
		
	5. Baking

		1. Pour the chocolate mix into ramekins.
			- This recipe should fill about 4 6oz ramekins
		2. Place the ramekins in a deep baking dish and fill with hot water.
			- Water does not need to be boiling, just as hot as your sink can manage
		3. Bake for 50-70 minutes at 300F
			- They should be set on the edges but still slightly jiggly in the center.
			- Too little baking will result in a pudding like consistancy
			- Too much baking will result in a thicker, cake like consistancy
			- (This is adjusted from the standard recipe, which uses half the eggs and bakes for 60-90 mintues. The extra eggs make the custard thicken much quicker)
		4. Take the ramekins out of the water and let them sit in the fridge for at least 4 hours.


	6. Serving

		1. Before serving, have them sit out of the fridge for about an hour to warm up to near room temperature.
		2. Garnish (Optional)
			- Whipped Cream
			- Fresh Mint Leaves
			- Candied Orange Peel
