# Instructions

	1. Prep
	
		1. Preheat the oven to 350F.
		2. Start a large pot of boiling, salted water.
		3. Have all ingredients ready.


	2. Pasta (Start the pasta first and make the sauce as the pasta cooks)

		1. When your pot reaches a rolling boil, add 1 lbs of tubular pasta
		2. Let boil for about 10-12 minutes, stir periodically
			- Taste test around 10 minutes, the pasta should be cooked slightly under al dente, as it will cook more while baking
		3. Strain the pasta water out with a collander, the pasta will be added to the sauce when ready

	3. Sauce

		1.  Coat the bottom of a large pot in olive oil and set on medium/low heat
		2.  Add 2 diced large onions
			- Yellow or white onions will work well for this
		3.  Add a tablespoon of salt to help draw out the moisture
		4.  Add 1 lbs of ground or chopped italian sausage
		5.  Stir on medium/low heat until sausage is cooked and onions are translucent
		6.  Add 8 cups of marinara sauce
		7.  Add sugar and cayanne pepper to taste
			- Sugar removes acidity, cayanne pepper adds depth to the flavor and spice
		8.  Add in the pasta when its ready
		9.  Add 4-5 handfuls of mozzerella cheese (until its stringy)
		10. Add a cup or more of parmesan cheese
		11. Add 4 cups of ricotta.

	4. Bake

		1. Pour the ziti mix into a casserole dish.
			- Leave some room at the top for extra marinara sauce, mozzerella, and any other toppings
		2. Add a layer of marinara sauce (~4 cups)
		3. Add a layer of mozzerella cheese
		4. Add some pepperoni or any other toppings (optional)
		5. Bake in the oven at 350F for about 20-25 minutes
		6. Take it out of the oven and let it cool for about 30 minutes
			- This will help it set a little bit
