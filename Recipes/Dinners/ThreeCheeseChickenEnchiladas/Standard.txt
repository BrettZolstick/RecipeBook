	2. Softening the tortillas

		1. Coat a medium sized pan with Vegetable Oil (or equivalent).
		2. Heat the oil on medium heat.
			- The oil should become slightly hazy. Dipping the edge of a tortilla in should cause tiny bubbles.
		3. One at a time, submerge the corn tortillas in the oil for a few seconds.
			- The tortilla should bubble up a little bit.
			- Leaving them in for too long will turn them into tortilla chips!
		4. Set the tortillas aside on a paper towel to soak excess oil


	3. Preparing the Enchilada Mix

		2. Add 4 oz of cream cheese

		4. Add about 1/4 tsp of salt
		5. Add about 1/4 tsp of pepper
		6. Add about 1/4 tsp of cumin
		7. Add 2 cups of chicken
		8. Add 4 cups of mexican cheese blend
		9. Add most of 1/2 cup of green onions. Save some to be used as a garnish before baking.

	4. Assembling the enchiladas

		1. Pour 10 oz of enchilada sauce into a medium sized mixing bowl
		2. Lightly oil a small baking dish
		3. Coat a tortilla in the enchilada sauce
		4. Place a small amount of the chicken mix in the tortilla and make it into a roll
		5. Place seam side down into a small baking dish
		6. Repeat until theres no more tortillas or dish is full
		7. Pour the remaining enchilada sauce into the dish over the enchiladas

	5. Baking
