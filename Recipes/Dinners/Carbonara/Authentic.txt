# Ingredients - Serves 4

	1/2 lbs 	- Guanciale (or pancetta [or reluctantly, thick cut bacon])
	3 			- Large Eggs
	1 			- Egg Yolk
	4 ounces 	- Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano (can blend, Pecorino is sharper Parmigiano is milder)
	1 lbs 		- Spaghetti (Not traditional, but substituting bucatini is fun)
				- Ground Black Pepper
				- Salt

				
# Cookware

	2 Medium mixing bowl
	1 Large Pan (Stainless Steel or similar)





# Instructions

	1. Guanciale (start with this so that its room temperature by the time its added to the pan)
		1. Get 1/2 lbs of Guanciale, Pancetta or worst case Thick Cut Bacon if you cant find the others
		2. Cut into chunks
		3. Set aside for later, will be closer to room temperature when its ready to be added to the pan

	
	2. Egg/cheese Mix
		1. Eggs
			1. Add 3 eggs to a medium mixing bowl
			2. Add 1 egg yolk

		2. Cheese
			1. Into a separate mixing bowl, finely grate 4oz of cheese
				# Either 100% Pecorino Romano, or a blend with Parmigiano-Reggiano as well

		3. Add a good amount of ground black pepper (no salt yet)

	2. Cooking

		# before starting the guanciale start a boiling pot of very salty water for the pasta
		# 	- The process from here on out is very time/temperature senstive, so make sure that everything 
		# 	  is ready so that it can be done quickly and repeatably

		1. Guanciale
			1. Add the Guanciale to a large, cold, stainless steel pan.
			2. Set on medium heat until the guanciale is fully cooked but not crispy
			3. Turn off the heat on the Guanciale pan and move on to cooking the pasta

		2. Pasta
			1. In a pot of already boiling very salty water, add 1 lbs of spaghetti (or bucatini)
			2. Stir until the pasta is at a consistancy you like.
			3. Move on to the combination step.

		3. Combination
			# - At this point, the Guanciale fat should not be bubbling anymore. Too high temperatures risk 
			#  	cooking the egg too far and making clumpy carbonara.
			
			1. Add the pasta into the Guanciale pan and toss it around so that its coated in the fat. (work quickly)
			2. Add the egg/chese mix and agitate rigorously.
				# The leftover heat in the pasta will be the only thing cooking the egg.
			3. Optionally add a little bit of pasta water to make it smoother if needed.
			4. Salt to taste if needed

	3. Serving
		1. Serve quickly, as it is best enjoyed fresh.
